# PokeLeague

This tiny role playing game (RPG) project demonstrates a text based version of a very popular cartoon series, POKEMON.
This project is created to practice coding with Java and implement some best practices. So it is just for fun.

## Roles

### 1. Pokemon
Pokemon is the key character of this game; they train, fight, and provides reputation to their owners.   
The idea of the game is to have the children learn how to collect as many Pokemon as possible, train them, and use them 
against other people's Pokemon by invoking the various abilities of each Pokemon creature.  
Pokemon can evolve and pass through various levels.

### 2. Pokemon Trainer
The Pokemon Trainer is a person who collects the Pokemon and tries to win tournaments. If a trainer doesn't have at least
3 pokemons with at least 20 energy point, he/she needs to train its pokemons. After each training session, pokemon earns +5
energy points, if it wins the training fight it earns extra +5 more points.  

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
This project is implemented with Java8, so if you want to run its executable you need to install relevant java version on your 
local machine.
